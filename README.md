# E-commerce-backend-management-system
A conceptual RESTful API backend built with Python (Flask/Django) for an e-commerce platform. It provides essential services for user management, product catalog, shopping carts, and order processing, designed for frontend integration.

Features
- User authentication (registration, login, RBAC for customers/admins)  
- Product management (CRUD operations)  
- Shopping cart functionality (add/remove items, update quantity)  
- Order processing and history  
- Stock management and validation

Technologies Used
- Python 3.x  
- Flask / Django (Web Framework)  
- PostgreSQL / SQLite (Database)  
- SQLAlchemy / Django ORM (ORM)  
- bcrypt / Django's built-in password hashing (Authentication)

File Structure
- `app.py` or `manage.py` → Main entry point depending on the framework used  
- `models.py` / Django `models/` → Defines database models for products, users, orders  
- `routes.py` / Django `views.py` → Handles page routing and logic  
- `templates/` → HTML templates for the frontend  
- `static/` → CSS, JS, and other static files  
- `cart.py`, `order.py` → Business logic for cart and checkout  
- `migrations/` → Database schema versions

How to Run
• Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git`
`cd YOUR_REPO_NAME`

• Create and activate a virtual environment:
 Recommended Python version: Python 3.10+
 – Windows:
  `python -m venv .venv`
  `.\.venv\Scripts\activate`
 – macOS/Linux:
  `python3 -m venv .venv`
  `source .venv/bin/activate`

• Install dependencies (choose based on framework):
 – For Flask-based implementation:
  `pip install Flask SQLAlchemy Flask-Migrate bcrypt`
 – For Django-based implementation:
  `pip install Django djangorestframework`

• Configure the database and run migrations:
 – For Flask:
  `flask db init`
  `flask db migrate`
  `flask db upgrade`
 – For Django:
  `python manage.py makemigrations`
  `python manage.py migrate`

• Run the server (depending on the framework):
 – Flask:
  `flask run`
 – Django:
  `python manage.py runserver`

### 🔧 Why it fixes the problem:
- `bash` blocks with triple backticks (` ```bash `) format commands cleanly.
- Each bullet is followed by a new line to avoid mashing lines together.
- Indentation is consistent.
